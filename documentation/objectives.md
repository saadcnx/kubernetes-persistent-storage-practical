# Practical Objectives

## Learning Goals
This practical is designed to provide hands-on experience with Kubernetes persistent storage management. By completing all tasks, you will gain practical skills in:

### Core Concepts
- Understanding Kubernetes storage architecture
- Differentiating between ephemeral and persistent storage
- Mastering PV, PVC, and StorageClass relationships

### Technical Skills
- Creating and configuring PersistentVolumes
- Managing PersistentVolumeClaims
- Implementing storage in application deployments
- Testing data persistence scenarios

### Operational Competencies
- Monitoring storage usage and performance
- Troubleshooting common storage issues
- Implementing storage best practices
- Managing multi-volume applications

## Detailed Objectives

### 1. Foundational Understanding

- **Explain** the lifecycle of PV and PVC objects
- **Understand** storage class concepts and provisioning

### 2. Implementation Skills
- **Create** PersistentVolumes with various configurations
- **Request** storage using PersistentVolumeClaims
- **Mount** persistent storage in application pods
- **Configure** storage classes and access modes

### 3. Persistence Verification
- **Test** data survival across pod restarts
- **Verify** storage availability after pod deletion
- **Demonstrate** multi-pod access patterns
- **Validate** storage capacity management

### 4. Advanced Operations
- **Implement** multi-volume applications
- **Monitor** storage usage and performance
- **Troubleshoot** common storage problems
- **Apply** security and optimization best practices

### 5. Production Readiness
- **Design** storage solutions for stateful applications
- **Implement** backup and recovery strategies
- **Configure** storage quotas and limits
- **Plan** for storage scalability

## Success Criteria
After completing this practical, you should be able to:

1. ✅ Deploy applications with persistent storage requirements
2. ✅ Manage storage resources effectively in Kubernetes
3. ✅ Troubleshoot storage-related issues independently
4. ✅ Design storage solutions for production workloads
5. ✅ Implement best practices for data persistence
